               <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
               <p>
                   I am currently an undergraduate in the field of computer science and engineering. I am really passionate about programming, even though sometimes I do get frustrated; but that is the fun part, of being a programmer. I am also interested in the hardware of computers and the binary logic, namely digital electronic, that is used to design computer system of any sort in our modern world. My love for computers started from my childhood, where I was enamoured by the incredible feats they achieved, such as, for example auto pilot, robot based car manufacturing and many more. My hobbies, unsurprisingly, consist of coding on chipsets like Arduino, creating websites or desktop applications and some gaming from time to time. In time I would like to become a better programmer who not only thinks of solving a problem, but on one that documents his code well and implements best practices while coding. My current ‘endgame’ is to become a data engineer, work on data pipelines and on other big data based technologies and with that I move one step at a time towards my goal; towards the future.
